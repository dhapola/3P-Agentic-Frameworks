This repository provides examples and reference architectures for building autonomous agents using popular frameworks on AWS services. These examples demonstrate how to leverage AWS services to create production-ready agent applications for various industry verticals. Examples will cover different layers of the agent stack including foundational models, orchestration, memory, tools, observability and evals, deployment patterns.
