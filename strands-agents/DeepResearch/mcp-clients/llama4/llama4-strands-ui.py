#Description:
#    Deep Research MCP client using Llama4 built on the Strands
#    framework using the Llama API.  This example is shows the typical multi-turn
#    processing utilized for most Deep Research model orchestraion.  
#    It uses AWS guardrails to allow for custom restrictions
#    to the model behavoir if needed. It also implements the ability to 
#    search an internal AWS Knowledge base and incorporate the results into
#    the final report.
#    This version includes a UI.

#Usage:
#    \$ streamlit run <filename>.py 
    
#Dependencies:
#    - mcp
#    - strands-agents
#    - strands-tools
#    - llama-api-client
#    - boto3
#    - Streamlit
