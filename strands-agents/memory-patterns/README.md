# Strands - Agentic Memory Patterns

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating practical implementations of hierarchical memory, consolidation, and semantic retrieval patterns for LLM-powered agents using the Strands framework.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- How to structure short-term, episodic, and long-term memory for an LLM-powered agent
- Techniques to consolidate episodic events and promote context to long-term stores
- How to use semantic retrieval from vector and graph stores to reduce hallucinations and enhance contextual reasoning
- Examples using memory orchestration tools compatible with Strands

## 🚗 Use Case: Automotive Service Center

The notebook implements an AI agent that assists in diagnosing and resolving car service complaints. The agent leverages different memory tiers to:
- Recall past interactions
- Reason over historical data
- Ground responses in semantic context

## 🛠️ Key Components

1. Memory Store Types:
   - Episodic Memory: Stores past service interactions
   - Long-Term Memory: Contains aggregated knowledge
   - Semantic Store: Implements vector and graph-based retrieval

2. Core Features:
   - Session Management
   - Hierarchical Memory Access
   - Semantic Memory Retrieval
   - Resolution Storage
   - Tool-Driven Reasoning

## 🔧 Implementation Patterns

1. Memory Orchestration
2. Consolidation Pattern
3. Semantic Retrieval
4. Tool-based Agent Interactions

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install required dependencies
2. Initialize memory stores
3. Set up the automotive toolkit
4. Create memory orchestrator
5. Implement agent with Strands framework

The notebook provides detailed examples and implementations for each component, making it easy to understand and adapt the patterns for other use cases.

## Testing Environment

This notebook was tested on SageMaker Studio Jupyter Lab.
