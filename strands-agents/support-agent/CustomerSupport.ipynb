      "\n",
      "4. Storage proximity - Upload performance can be impacted by the geographic distance between your origin and the storage service's data center. Services typically have regional endpoints to optimize proximity.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Hardware constraints - On the client side, disk I/O speed and available network bandwidth from your origin can be limiting factors.\n",
