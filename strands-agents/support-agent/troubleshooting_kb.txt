# API Service Troubleshooting
Issue: API Rate Limit Exceeded
Solution: If you're hitting API rate limits, check your current usage in the dashboard. Common solutions:
1. Implement request batching
2. Use caching for frequently accessed data
3. Request a limit increase if needed
Best Practice: Monitor your API usage trends and set up alerts before hitting limits.

Issue: API Authentication Errors
Solution: Common authentication issues can be resolved by:
1. Verify API keys are valid and not expired
2. Check if the API key has proper permissions
3. Ensure you're using HTTPS for all API calls
4. Validate the API endpoint region matches your configuration
Best Practice: Rotate API keys regularly and never share them in code repositories.

# Storage Service Issues
Issue: Slow Upload Performance
Solution: To improve storage upload performance:
1. Check your network connectivity
2. Use multipart uploads for large files
3. Verify you're using the closest region
4. Consider using acceleration endpoints
Best Practice: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff.

Issue: Storage Access Denied
Solution: For storage access issues:
1. Verify IAM permissions
2. Check bucket policies
3. Ensure encryption settings are correct
4. Validate access point configuration
Best Practice: Use least privilege access and regularly audit permissions.

# Database Service Problems
Issue: High Database Latency
Solution: To resolve database latency:
1. Check connection pool settings
2. Monitor query performance
3. Review index usage
4. Consider read replicas for read-heavy workloads
Best Practice: Set up performance monitoring and alerts.

Issue: Database Connection Failures
Solution: For connection issues:
1. Verify security group settings
2. Check network ACLs
3. Validate credential rotation
4. Ensure connection limits haven't been reached
Best Practice: Implement connection pooling and proper error handling.

# Compute Service Issues
Issue: Instance Performance Degradation
Solution: For poor instance performance:
1. Monitor CPU and memory usage
2. Check disk I/O metrics
3. Review network performance
4. Consider instance resizing
Best Practice: Use auto-scaling based on performance metrics.

Issue: Instance Launch Failures
Solution: When instances fail to launch:
1. Verify AMI availability
2. Check instance quotas
3. Validate subnet capacity
4. Review security group rules
Best Practice: Maintain AMI hygiene and document launch configurations.
